        <p>This page is about some of the work that for my high school robotics team. I was a part of FRC team 8, Paly Robotics. We competed in the FIRST robotics challenge however we also did many things outside of the competition. 
            As a team we also do a lot of community outreach events to get elementary and middle schoolers interested in robotics. 
            I largely did machining (mill, lathe, cnc mill, TIG welder, and more) and some CAD (solidworks) my freshman year on the team. My sophomore year, I sharpened my CAD skills and designed a few subsystems for our robot which won the Utah regional while also winning the quality award. 
            Following this I took the role of design lead where I led strategic design, taught mechanical design / CAD, and continued to design systems for robots and team projects.
            I also participated in many robot demos in which we would drive the robots and interact with students and tell them about robotics opportunities available to them such as FIRST lego league. 
            I was also a counselor for our summer camp, I mentored a group of students as they designed and built a robot that would play a game that we created.

                This is a rendering and photo of the robot that we built for the 2020 FIRST robotics challenge. The parts that I designed are shown below.
                This robot won the Utah regional and also won the quality award there. The team also qualified for the world championships however it was cancelled because of the pandemic.

                The first mechanism that I designed on this robot was a climbing mechanism. The objective of the climber was to pull the robot off the ground by grabbing onto the bar shown here. 
                the bar could swing depending on the balance of the robots on it and extra points were awarded to a balanced bar. We decided that the design requirements for up were to be able to reach the bar and pull up the whole robot from both the highest and lowest possible positions.
                We also decided that being able to reposition on the bar was desired however.

            <p>The sketch on the far left shows the outline of the climber. The design consists of 3 concentric square boxbeams with ball bearings on the inside to prevent contact between boxbeams and reduce friction.
                the climber was actuated with a spool such that when it was wound in the climber would be pushed up and when it was spun the other way the climber would be pulled downwards.
                we also designed and made a hook for repositioning on the bar however it was not used in competition due to weight issues.

            <p>the next part that I designed was the electronics board. The priority for the electronics board was to reduce wire and pneumatic tube length wherever possible especially for the battery cables, minimize maintenance time, and to keep the parts safe.
                the whole system is on shock mounts so that vibrations would not disconnect any electronics and the cover is mounted with thumb screws so that it can be quickly accessed. </p>

            Though the typical robotics challenge was cancelled for 2021, FIRST robotics created a couple of asynchronous competitions for teams to compete in. One of these competition was the Innovation Challenge. 
            FIRST robotics challenged teams to create something that "Identify a problem or opportunity and design a solution to help people regain or achieve optimum physical or mental health and fitness". 
            Our team created "sightwalk" chest mounted device that would use computer vision to identify obstacles on the sidewalk and provide instructions for blind people to avoid them. I designed the housing and harness system for this project. 
            Out of thousands of entrants worldwide, we placed third, this is something I am very proud of.

            A lot of the time while I was design lead was during the pandemic, teaching CAD and mechanical design was definitely more challenging. One of the event I organized with the design team was a cad competition.
            We participated in a robot design/CAD competition hosted by frc team 254 in which we would design and CAD a robot that would be evaluated by judges. Most of the team were able to participate and we split into teams of 2-4 and designed 
            a robot to climb a pole in 48 hours. This is what my friend and I were able to design in 48 hours in solidworks. The idea of the design is to use the weight of the robot to create a large normal force and friction force to ride the pole upwards.

            <p>the left image is the upper portion which would go behind the pole and prevent the robot from falling backwards. The right image is the lower portion which is powered and has a hardstop to prevent it from being pushed into the robot.
