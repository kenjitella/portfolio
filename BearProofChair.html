        <p>This Project "bear proof chair" was one of the two projects that I worked on in the class Mechanics: 3D design (this class was previously called stress analysis). 
            Aside from projects, in the class we also expanded our knowlage from Mechanics: 2D design (this class used to be called statics) to include new ways forces and moments can be applied with an additional dimension. 
            The next half of this class was focused on stress analysis.
             The Bear-Proof chair was the second project in this class. For this project we were instructed to find a target group that would make use of a bear proof chair camping. 
             As a group we decided to design our chair such that it would suit parents taking their children camping for the first time. 
             On top of the original goals requirements of beaing a bear proof camping chair,
              which would have to be able to withstand attacks from a bear and being compact,
               we added that it should be inexpndsive because in the case that the children do not like camping the parents would not have spent too much,
                and that the chair is low to the ground so it is accesable to any child. 
             The design requirements that these goal translated to were that the chair must have an FOS of 3 with the weight of a large bear(1200 lbs) which is equal to FOS of 36 with a 100lbs child. 
             The next design requirement was that te chair must fold flat to less than 3 inches so that it would not be an inconvenice to take camping. 
            The next design requirement of cost went hand in hand with the buget limit for this project, our limit to build this chair was $180.
            Lastly, we required that the chair be low to the ground such that where the butt of the usere would be is at most one tibia length from the ground (12 inches to be conservative)

            <p>This is a photo of our CAD for the chair. Things that are not pictured in the chair are the fabric which is a relativly thick laminated nylon fabric and cables that connect the bottom of the chair to the legs to prevent the legs from over extending. 
                We decided to make the chiar out of 8020 aluminium extrusion because it is super easy to made modifications if necessary and assemble which is ideal for things that are not mass produced like our chair.
