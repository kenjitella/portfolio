            The Bike Crank Projects is a team project that was part of the Mechanics: 3D design class. 
            The goal of this project was to create a bike crank of a certain length that would break at a certain load within a margin in the middle of the part. 
            The load would also be offset to the side to create a moment about the axis that runs the length of the linkage. (see testing gif for refrence)
            A part that broke at the connection would be counted as a failure. We would also be graded on the weight of the bike crank.

            <p>This is our initial desing, our though process here was to create a crank with two squares (the conneciton points) and an area in the middle with less cross sectional area
                to create a stress concentration. Using FEA we tuned the cross section at the middle such that the FEA would be 1. We were also given 1/8" thick acylic only to make this part
                and by our hand calculations and FEA, to create a crank of reasonable size, the part would have to be 1/4" thick. We used JB weld epoxy to gule 2 1/8" thick parts together to achived our desiered part.

            Our initial design failed because the failure point was not in the middle. We believe this happened because the tolerance we created between at the connection point was too large. 
            The space between the square rod and our crank was slightly too big which led to the corners of the square rod resting on the flat part of the square cut out creating a stress concentration.
             This was not forseen in the FEA because in solidworks FEA, the entire face on which the force is applied is selected and it is not possible to  
            for our final design we increased the radius around the square cutout at the connection and also decreased the tolerance.

            <p>This is our final desing, there is material around the connections so that the areas of highest stress dosent occour at the connection point.
                We also had some consistency issues due to the way that the glue was applied not being the same every time (air bubbles, cure time, not exact same position)
                so we developed a procedure that we would follow every time so that force that the crank would break at would be the same every time.  </p>
