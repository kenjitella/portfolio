        <h4 class="writing">Hello, This is Kenji Tella and this is my website. 
            I created this website to show off a projects that that I have worked on and to learn front end web development.
            <br>
            I love robotics and mechanical engineering, During high school I spent 4 years during robotics where I was the design lead.
            <a href="https://www.palyrobotics.com/"> Here</a> is a link to my teams website. 
            <br>
            Outside of my classwork a lot of my time is spent running.
            I run track and cross country for Carnegie Mellon University.
            In track I mainly race the 3000, 5000, and steeplechase, and in cross country I mostly race 8 kilometers (depends on the course).
